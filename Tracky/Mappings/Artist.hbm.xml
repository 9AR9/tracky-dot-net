NOTE:
This NHibernate XML mapping file remains in the main project's Mappings folder only as 
an historical example of NHibernate's original mapping strategy. This approach has
been deprecated in my usage in favor of the FluentNHibernate library, which allows
the mapping to be done in code that acts directly upon the domain entities.
